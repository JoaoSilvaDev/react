# React Log #

Last year I built a portfolio website with React for my girlfriend.
I haven't touched React or webdev since then and I'm very very rust (coudln't even build a todo app)

*3 months of heavy practicing and 6 months of not even looking at code*

I'll be logging my practice here.

**Disclaimers**:
* This is not a tutorial.
* I've worked through a third of React course on udemy but it wasn't working for me.
* I have basic programming knowledge, I've done a lot of games using Unity (C#) and some webdev outside of React.
